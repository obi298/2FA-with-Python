# Introduction
One-Time Password(OTP) is a password that is used for one login session on a user's device. OTPs can be delivered to users through text messages, authenticator apps, email, and more. It can be used as an additional layer of security for users to confirm their identities. The purpose of this lab is to learn about OTP and how it can be used in real world scenarios.

- Authenticator Apps (Microsoft Authenticator)



# Project
I first imported the required libraries for this project. The required libraries for this project were, pyotp, qrcode and getpass. I then generated a secret key that was used for the next code.

The secrret key was then used in the next code

I then created the user's name and issuer name which will be displayed on the authenticator app.
